    - subject: Bump tar-fs to 3.1.1
      hash: da1ed85d7c5f2385274e905a6f2efdb7af11d07e
      body: >
        tar-fs@3.1.1 patches CVE-2025-59343, but this causes mocha-pod to error
        with

        'not a valid symlink' (thrown from tar-fs) when restoring backed up
        files

        that are symlinks. We bypass the symlink validation as the restored
        files are

        being restored from a known system, so are trusted.

        This passes the following build arguments to the docker build

        - NODE_VERSION: full Node version of the host
        - NODE_MAJOR_VERSION: major Node version of the host
        - BALENA_ARCH: infered balena arch from the host or configured by the
          user
        - BALENA_MACHINE_NAME: infered balena machine name from the host or as
          configured by the user

         This allows to better work with CI environments and modify the docker
         build depending on the CI environment node version.

    - subject: Add restore() method to TestFs.Disabled
      hash: 9bb1295295d9e369a35f671dd0952c6b7c69aa39
      body: >
        This is a DX improvement as it allows TestFs instances to be defined
        once

        and used multiple times. The instance will store the internal state and

        only perform the restore operation if the instance has not yet been

        enabled. Enabling the same intance twice is not allowed though and it

        will throw an error.


        Example:


        ```ts

        // Prepare a new test fs.

        const tmp = testfs({ '/etc/test.conf': 'logging=true' });


        // Enable the instance. The /etc/test.conf file will be created

        await tmp.enable();


        // The file should be available after setup

        expect(await fs.readFile('/etc/test.conf',
        'utf-8')).to.equal('logging=true');


        // RUN YOUR TESTS HERE


        // Restore the filesystem

        // Since test.conf did not exist before the enable(), this step removes
        the file

        await tmp.restore();


        // We can enable the instance again for new tests

        await tmp.enable();


        // Trying to enable again before restore() will throw and

        // restore the system to the previous state

        await expect(tmp.enable()).to.be.rejected();


        // This should succeed

        await expect(fs.access('/etc/test.conf')).to.be.rejected;


        // Trying to restore again will have no effect

        await tmp.restore();

        ```

- commits:
    - body: |-
        Reverts BetterLock configuration to the defaults. The previous
        configuration only allowed one element in the queue at the time and
        added some useless logging to the debug log.
        This also modifies the `enable` function to try to restore files if
        anything happens during the replacement.

- commits:
    - body: |-
        In previous versions, only one testfs instance was allowed to be
        set at the time. This was enforced by a global lock to prevent causing
        filesystem inconsistencies if restoring the same set of files.
        While this technically worked, it was too restrictive, as users may have
        wanted to have a global testfs instance for all tests, while having
        local testfs instances for specific tests.
        With this new feature, multiple testfs instances are allowed as long as
        they are restored in reverse order as they were set.

- commits:
    - body: >-
        This changes the behavior of the global testfs configuration in
        `.mochapodrc.yml`.

        The given configuration is now used to set a default instance in the
        `beforeAll` hook.

        This change is still minor as the outcome of running the tests is still
        the same.

        mocha-pod projects to be used in different contexts without the need to
        modify the configuration file for each context.

        Splits integration tests into an earlier stage of the build process.
        Unit tests and linting are performed in a later stage to ensure that
        only code that compiles is merged to master.
        This means that when running `npm run test:integration` only integration
        tests will be built, increasing development test speed.

        This commit also fixes caching, the cache will now include the built

        image id. This means the second run should use the cache unless

        something has changed in the source files.
